# SMART-BUS
Safety Monitoring And Riskless Transport (SMART) BUS

PROBLEM STATEMENT:    

   Indian Government has resumed operation of buses almost all routes . This above act created two types of  people in our society 
1. People who doesnâ€™t bother of crowd
2. People who is fear of using public transport . 
   If there are more passengers in bus there may be more cause of spreading covid-19. Considering this if we stop public transport, many people without private transport will suffer a lot . This may cause huge impact on society. 

SOLUTION:
  1) Monitoring and allowing the passengers with stipulated count with safety protocols is the best solution for above problem. Fear of travelling in public transport will get rid to passengers if they travel with great safety.
  2) Monitoring the count and checking the safety is our solution. 
  3) Our product is based on the counter and the image processing . We will set a buzzer which is connected with thermal detecting sensor which is placed in the steps of the bus , once passengers gets in it will count the passengers . At the same time we will place a sanitizer chamber on the doorsteps. We also placed a camera which will focus passengers to detect whether they are wearing mask or not. Buses with these equipment is innovative

 PROCESS FLOW
 
 S.No | FEATURES POINT | DETAILS
--- | --- | ---
1| `COUNTER` | **The image processing camera detects the number of passengers inside the bus so that the protocols of social distancing is followed by  limiting the number of passengers**
2| `FACE MASK DETECTION` | **Using camera and image processing technique we can detect whether passengers  are wearing the face mask or not.**
3| `SANITIZING` | **For safety precaution passengers were sanitized while entering into the bus.**
4| `THERMAL SCANNER` | **Human body temperature is set in folaida sensor which measures body temperature of passengers while entering the bus. With the help of temperature the passengers can be filtered and allowed inside the bus**
